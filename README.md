# Threat-Intelligence-Log-URL-IP-Analyzer

Developed a comprehensive Python-based cybersecurity tool that processes network logs and analyzes URLs/IP addresses against threat intelligence databases to identify security threats. Implemented advanced parallel processing and optimization techniques, reducing processing time by 99% (from 10-60 minutes to 15-30 seconds) for enterprise-scale datasets up to 5GB. Created both command-line and web interfaces with real-time visualization dashboards, enabling security teams to proactively detect malicious network activity and policy violations. The tool operates completely offline while maintaining high accuracy in threat detection through sophisticated cross-referencing and statistical analysis algorithms.
