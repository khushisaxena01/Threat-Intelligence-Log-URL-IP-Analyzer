# Threat-Intelligence-Log-URL-IP-Analyzer

Developed a comprehensive Python-based cybersecurity tool that processes network logs and analyzes URLs/IP addresses against threat intelligence databases to identify security threats. Implemented advanced parallel processing and optimization techniques, reducing processing time by 99% (from 10-60 minutes to 15-30 seconds) for enterprise-scale datasets up to 5GB. Created both command-line and web interfaces with real-time visualization dashboards, enabling security teams to proactively detect malicious network activity and policy violations. The tool operates completely offline while maintaining high accuracy in threat detection through sophisticated cross-referencing and statistical analysis algorithms.

The primary objectives encompassed both functional and performance requirements:
- Data Processing Capability: Analyze URLs and IP addresses from multiple file formats (CSV, TXT, XML) with support for various encoding standards and delimiter configurations
- Visualization and Reporting: Generate clear visualizations of security status classifications with interactive dashboards and exportable reports
- Scalability: Implement efficient processing for large datasets (up to 5GB) using parallel processing and memory optimization techniques
- User Interface Design: Create both command-line and web-based interfaces to accommodate different user preferences and deployment scenarios
- Security Compliance: Ensure complete offline functionality while maintaining data integrity and processing accuracy
